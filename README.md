## What is the app about?

Have you ever heard of paprika?  It is an app for storing food and recipes that one uses.  Theres only one thing they could improve upon in my opinion?  There's a lackluster ways to import recipies through the app.  Well what if there was an app designed to store recipes to the cloud?  Where you could store any recipe you want and grab any recipe?  Introducing, Sizzle.  An app that does all that and more!

##  Goal

Create an app where one can make recipes, store them, and share them with others or strangers online.

## Features

* Creating readable and functional recipes
* Share recipes on an online database
* Change style of recipe showings (old fashioned, modern, etc).
